# Music-Sniffle
- Text-based Music Application entirely coded in Java.

### ```How to run:``` ###
- Make sure you have Java installed!
- download a zip folder, extract and open ur fav IDE!
- **MAKE SURE IT's IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY!!!**
  - to ensure you are on the right directory...
    - make sure you have the terminal on ./A1 or ./A2
    - depending on which assignment you want to run!
- run it or type in the following into the terminal:
  - ```javac MyAudioUI.java```
  - ```java MyAudioUI```
  - and u should be fine

### ```Two Assignments ...``` ###
- A1 and A2
- A1 is the first version of the assignment
  - this features the entire text app
  - the difference is the music is all hardcoded
- A2 is the second version of the assignment
  - this features the entire text app like A1
  - but, the difference is the music is in a store.txt file
  - and the exceptions are actually thrown!
- A2 is the better version of the assignment (i think)

### ```Differences!``` ###
- the main differences between both code is:
  - how MyAudioUI functions 
  - what data AudioContentStore is coming from
  - how the Library file has changed from returning booleans to catching exceptions 

### ```Purpose``` ###
- This code is meant for CPS209!
